# kitritiled
This is a copy of Ted Yapo's tritiled project from https://github.com/tedyapo/tritiled. It is based on the V3.1 design.
I did my best to reproduce the schematic, and optimize it for automated assembly as opposed to hand-assembly. As a result, it uses some slightly different parts, such as 0402 components when possible.
